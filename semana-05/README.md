## Other information:
In the folder you can see a file containing the primitive structure of the landing page of the application made only in html code and the respective definition of styles, divided into 4 respective stylesheets: footer, header, main, and aside, which are located in the CSS folder.
In this instance I have worked on a responsive design of the landing page using flex box as the main tool. The mobile and tablet designs can be seen correctly, but the responsive design for desktop will be damaged, because the work is incomplete.
